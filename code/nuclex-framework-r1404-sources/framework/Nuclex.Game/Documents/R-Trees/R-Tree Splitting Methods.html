<H1 align=3Dcenter>Splitting Methods</H1>They differ primarily in the =
techniques=20
used to split an overflowing node during insertion. The goal is to =
minimize=20
coverage and overlap. These goals are at times contradictory and thus =
heuristics=20
are often used. The node splitting algorithms described below range from =
being=20
quite simple (e.g., exhaustive search) to being fairly complicated =
(e.g.,=20
R*-tree <A=20
href=3D"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~brabec/quadtree/docs/references.html#beck9=
0c">[Beck90c]</A>).=20
Some just split the overflowing node, while others try to reinsert some =
of the=20
objects and nodes from the overflowing nodes thereby striving for better =
overall=20
behavior (e.g., reduction in coverage and overlap).=20

  <LI><FONT color=3Dred>Exhaustive Search: </FONT>If the R-tree node =
overflows,=20
  then try all possible ways of splitting the node into two new nodes =

that=20
  can be stored in a node. Choose the split which causes bounding boxes =

  Thus the goal of this method is to reduce the coverage. This method is =
quite=20
  complex as it tries all possibilities. <A name=3Dquad></A>
  <LI><FONT color=3Dred>Quadratic method: </FONT>Examine all the =
children of the=20
  overflowing node and find the pair of bounding boxes that would waste =
the most=20
  area were they to be inserted in the same node. This is determined by=20
  subtracting the sum of the areas of the two bounding boxes from the =
area of=20
  the covering bounding box. These two bounding boxes are placed in =
separate=20
  nodes, say <I>j </I>and <I>k </I>. The set of remaining bounding boxes =
are=20
  examined and the bounding box <I>i </I>whose addition maximizes the =
difference=20
  in coverage between the bounding boxes associated with <I>j </I>and =
<I>k=20
  </I>is added to the node whose coverage is minimized by the addition. =
This=20
  process is reapplied to the remaining bounding boxes <A=20

  <LI><FONT color=3Dred>Linear Method:</FONT> Find the two bounding =

  <LI><FONT color=3Dred>R*-tree:</FONT> The R*-tree <A=20
  =
href=3D"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~brabec/quadtree/docs/references.html#beck9=
0c">[Beck90c]</A>=20
  is a name given to a variant of the R-tree which makes use of the most =
complex=20
  of the node splitting algorithms. The algorithm differs from the other =

  algorithms as it attempts to reduce both overlap and coverage. In =
particular,=20
  the primary focus is on reducing overlap with ties broken by favoring =
the=20
  splits that reduce the coverage by using the splits that minimize the=20
  perimeter of the bounding boxes of the resulting nodes. In addition, =
when a=20
  node <I>a </I>overflows, instead of immediately splitting <I>a </I>, =
an=20
  attempt is made first to see if some of the objects in <I>a </I>could =
possibly=20
  be more suited to being in another node. This is achieved by =
reinserting a=20
  fraction (30% has been found to yield good performance <A=20

  of these objects in the tree (termed <I>forced reinsertion</I>). The =
node is=20
  only split if it has been found to overflow after reinsertion has =
taken place.=20
  This method is quite complex. <A name=3Dang></A>
  <LI><FONT color=3Dred>Ang/Tan Method: </FONT>Form four sets, one for =
each face=20
  (i.e., side) of the overflowing node <I>a </I>. Associate each =
bounding box=20
  <I>o </I>in <I>a </I>with the closest face of <I>a </I>in each of the =
two=20
  dimensions. Once the four sets representing four partitions have been=20
  constructed (i.e., each bounding box <I>o </I>has been associated with =
two=20
  sets), select the partition that ensures the most even distribution of =

  bounding boxes. In case of a tie, choose the partition with the least =

  It has two stages. In our implementation, the first stage orders the =
centroids=20
  of the objects in Peano-Hilbert order. The second stage fills the leaf =
nodes=20
  by examining the objects in increasing Peano-Hilbert order of their =
centroids=20
  (obtained by the first stage). Each leaf node is filled with the first =

  unprocessed object and its <I>M-1 </I>nearest neighbors (in the space =
in which=20
  the objects lie) which have not yet been inserted in other leaf nodes. =
Once an=20
  entire level of the packed R-tree has been obtained, the algorithm is=20
  reapplied to add nodes at the next level using the same nearest =
neighbor=20
  criterion, terminating when a level contains just one node. The only=20
  difference between the ordering that is applied at the levels =
containing the=20
  nonleaf nodes from that used at the level of the leaf nodes is that in =
the=20
  former case we are ordering the bounding boxes while in the latter =
case we are=20
  ordering the actual objects. <A name=3Dhilpack></A>
