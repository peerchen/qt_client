  ///     This class follows the usual game state concept: Instead of using
  ///     hard to maintain if/else trees for deciding whether to render the main menu,
  ///     game scene or credits scroller, each of the game's phases is put in its own
  ///     game state class. This improves modularity and helps keeping parts of code
  ///     separated that have nothing to with each other. The game state manager
  ///     allows multiple states to be active at the same time and manages these
  ///     active states in a stack, which is useful for realizing ingame menus
  ///     and nested scenes.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     Game states can be either active or inactive and will be notified when this
  ///     state changes by the OnEntered() and OnLeaving() methods. Any game state
  ///     starts out as being inactive. Game states should only load and keep their
  ///     resources during their active period and free them again when they
  ///     become inactive.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     In addition to being active and inactive, game states also have a pause mode.
  ///     This mode can only be entered by active game states and is used to put
  ///     the game state in the back when another game state serves as a means to halt
  ///     the time in the game state. If multiple game states are active, only
  ///     the topmost state will be in unpaused mode.
